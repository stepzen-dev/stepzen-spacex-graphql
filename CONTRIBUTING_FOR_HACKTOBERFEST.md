# Introduction

Thank you so much for contributing to our StepZen sample. We hope it provides you a fun opportunity to dig a little bit deeper into GraphQL! 

Here are some things to keep in mind before you begin.

## PRs We Are Looking For

To avoid receiving an _invalid_ or _spam_ label on your PR, please:
1. comment on and claim an issue that is already present on the repo 
2. or create an issue for us to review that your PR will resolve, before you make the PR

Then link to the issue in your PR. 

## Helpful Tools

To make sure your code is formatted well, we recommend using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). 
The [GraphQL VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GraphQL.vscode-graphql) is also helpful if VSCode is your IDE of choice.
[curl](https://curl.se/) is useful for checking on API call responses.

## Getting the project running on your machine
To get the project running on your machine and open up the UI in the browser, follow the instructions in the README.md. 

## Making your PR

We recommend following the steps in [this guide](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/) to make your PR-- fork, then clone your fork, create an upstream pointing to this repo, then create your branch and commit/push your changes there before making a PR. 

## Asking to Pair
Stuck? Lonely? Comment on the issue that you're resolving and ask us to pair! We've got time set aside on our Calendlys this month!
